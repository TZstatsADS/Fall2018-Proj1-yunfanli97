Due to the inherent differences in physical structures between male and female, roles have been defined and redefined over time. Generally, male and female could have distinguished points of view of understanding on same issue. When it comes to daily life, this gender difference still plays an significant role. We experience various mood and feelings every day. Will gender difference plays an effect on our mood? To be more specific, how will gender affect our happy moments every day?  Is there a difference between female and male on happiness sources? This project will analyze this gender effect on happy moments based on the HappyDB dataset.
